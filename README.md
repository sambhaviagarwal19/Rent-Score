# RentScore: ML-Based Risk Assessment for Car Rentals

A Random Forest-powered machine learning solution for customer risk evaluation in the car rental industry, offering enhanced decision-making, risk mitigation, and operational efficiency.

---

## ðŸš— Project Overview

*RentScore* is a predictive system that leverages machine learning to analyze customer data (e.g., driving history, fines, license status, accident records) and generate a risk score. This enables car rental providers to make informed, data-driven decisions before approving rentals, helping to reduce defaults, losses, and fraud.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Random Forest-based risk scoring model
- Frontend UI for entering customer details
- Flask backend for processing and serving predictions
- Google Colab for training the ML model
- MySQL (via Excel-based schema) for database storage
- Risk classification visualization similar to credit scoring systems

---

## âš™ Technologies Used

- Python, Flask, HTML, CSS
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- Google Colab (training environment)
- Pandas, NumPy (data handling)
- Excel & MySQL for database
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualizations)

---

## ðŸ”„ System Workflow

1. *Data Ingestion*: User inputs customer info through a web form.
2. *Data Processing*: Backend preprocesses inputs for ML model.
3. *Prediction Engine*: Random Forest model predicts customer risk class.
4. *Response Output*: Risk score is returned and displayed on the UI.
5. *Storage*: Data is stored for future review and analysis.
